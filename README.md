# A Simple Blockchain

<h2>Description</h2>
A python script containing a simple blockchain implimentation, with mining functionality. The program creates a blockchain then mines for blocks to add onto that blockchain, encrypting them with hashes using the hashlib library. I utilized python for its ease-of-use.
The purpose of this small project was to better understand the technology behind blockchains.
More complexity may be added in the future.

<h2>Developer Notes</h2>
Depending on the difficult setting in the script, it may take a few moments for each block to be mined.
